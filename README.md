# CodingPractice
Here is where I'll put my programs I've written for practice.
## Directories
* **java**: Contains files written in Java and their compile files.
* **cpp**: Contains files written in C++ and their compile files.
* **multiclass**: Contains a copy of the files in the multiclass directory which is in the java directory. I can't figure out how to delete this one, maybe I'll figure it out later.
