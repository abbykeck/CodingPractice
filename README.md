# CodingPractice
Here is where I'll put my programs I've written for practice.
## Brief program descriptions
* **GroceryList.java**: Asks the user for String inputs until the user ends the loop, then fills an Arraylist with the string inputs and prints the ArrayList.
* (note to self for running java programs: use javac filename.java, make sure filename.class is created, then java filename)
